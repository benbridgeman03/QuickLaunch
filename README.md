# QuickLaunch

**_Work in progress_**

QuickLaunch is a small tool designed to replace the unreliable Windows Search experience. Windows’ built-in search is slow, inconsistent, and often can’t find apps or files you actually use. QuickLaunch aims to be a faster, no-nonsense way to open programs and locate files without the usual hassle.
