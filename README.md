# QuickLaunch

> **Work in Progress**

QuickLaunch is a lightweight launcher built to replace the unreliable Windows Search experience. Windows’ built-in search is often slow, inconsistent, and fails to surface apps or files you use every day. QuickLaunch focuses on speed, simplicity, and predictable results.
